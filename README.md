# Linear Congruential Generator Projects

This repository contains projects related to the **Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)** algorithm, starting with the LCG Period Detection project.

## Project 1: LCG Period Detection

This project demonstrates the generation of pseudo-random numbers using the **Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)** algorithm and detects when the sequence starts repeating, known as **period detection**.

### Features:
- Takes user inputs for the LCG parameters: 
  - **Multiplier (a)**
  - **Increment (c)**
  - **Modulus (m)**
  - **Initial seed (X0)**
- Detects when the sequence of random numbers repeats (the **period**).
- Plots the random numbers generated against the iteration count for visualization.
